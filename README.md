# Introduction
part 1: is the operation of the LED with a simple electrical circuit in addition to the special programming code that shows the inputs and outputs of the signals with the specified lighting duration (Delay).


part 2: is operation of the LED Matrix and I used the shape (heart) to make it the only one that works , The LED Matrixes consist of an array of LEDs arranged in a grid. This display has a total of 64 LEDs in 8 rows and 8 columns.
